# Analyze a client's needs for their film festival - Openclassrooms
Project to-dos
1. Website prototype
You'll need to make a first version of the site that meets all the requirements Jennifer explained above. The website prototype should be in HTML and CSS with or without Bootstrap as you wish. You can use a Bootstrap them if you want. You don't actually need to buy the .com or the .org though; you can simply propose it in your project brief.

The pre-registration page doesn't need to be functional. It should be a simple page with a form that doesn't actually submit data to a real codebase.

The webpage you build can be a local set of HTML and CSS files on your computer. It should not be hosted online. 

Make the HTML/CSS site and project brief as aesthetically pleasing as possible! Pay attention to detail, and communicate a sense of brand identity through your font, color, image, and sizing choices. Creating this brand identity is up to you -- however you interpret the film festival itself. 

2. Project brief
Make your communication with the client easier by writing a document that puts you both on the same page! ðŸ™Œ In it, you'll cover logistical details about the overall project as well as technical details about the website you create.

Create a project brief from the description above and the clientâ€™s requests. It must have the following elements:

Summary

Stakeholders

Goals

Budget

Timeline

Technical specifications (explanation of design and technical choices that were made, even if they're basic)
 
Deliverables

A project brief explaining your client's needs, including an explanation of the technologies you chose and why

Your HTML and CSS source code (plus other files if necessary) your site does not need to be hosted online.
