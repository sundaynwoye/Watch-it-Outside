# Analyze a client's needs for their film festival - Openclassrooms
Clara has a budget of $3,500 to get the event website up and running. She needs to communicate online about her festival in order to announce the upcoming showings and take reservations!

Here's what she says:

My company, "Watch it Outside" just got the approval to show movies in Boston Public Garden this year from August 5th through 8th, from 6pm to midnight. We can't wait to help the public discover awesome films!

I need to publicize the festival, and to do this, I need a website. On this site, I need to display information about the festival, the films we're showing, and regularly published news or announcements about the festival.

There should also be links to the city of Bostonâ€™s news website, the Boston Public Gardenâ€™s website, and our Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts somewhere on the page (navigation bar, footer links, etc). Since I haven't created these accounts yet, you can just have each social media icon as a link to its homepage (ex. https://twitter.com).

Shows will be free and open to everyone, but I want people to be able to pre-register so that I'm able to estimate how many people might come and so that we can close registration if it reaches the venueâ€™s capacity of 1,500 people.

I'd like to have a professional web address, either a .com or .org -- you decide, but just make sure it's relevant to the film festival. However, until we are ready to launch, can you please make sure that the site is not made public or put online, I donâ€™t want anyone signing up too early in case we change the schedule.

Project to-dos
1. Website prototype
You'll need to make a first version of the site that meets all the requirements Jennifer explained above. The website prototype should be in HTML and CSS with or without Bootstrap as you wish. You can use a Bootstrap them if you want. You don't actually need to buy the .com or the .org though; you can simply propose it in your project brief.

The pre-registration page doesn't need to be functional. It should be a simple page with a form that doesn't actually submit data to a real codebase.

The webpage you build can be a local set of HTML and CSS files on your computer. It should not be hosted online. 

Make the HTML/CSS site and project brief as aesthetically pleasing as possible! Pay attention to detail, and communicate a sense of brand identity through your font, color, image, and sizing choices. Creating this brand identity is up to you -- however you interpret the film festival itself. 

2. Project brief
Make your communication with the client easier by writing a document that puts you both on the same page! ðŸ™Œ In it, you'll cover logistical details about the overall project as well as technical details about the website you create.

Create a project brief from the description above and the clientâ€™s requests. It must have the following elements:

Summary

Stakeholders

Goals

Budget

Timeline

Technical specifications (explanation of design and technical choices that were made, even if they're basic)
 
Deliverables

A project brief explaining your client's needs, including an explanation of the technologies you chose and why

Your HTML and CSS source code (plus other files if necessary) your site does not need to be hosted online.
